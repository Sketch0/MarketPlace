                Hello guys , My self Darshan founder and CEO of this start up where we publish projects and models belonging to the AI and ML also integrated Data science in GUI form.
                <br>
                Today I am going to introduce my AI GUI application in which I used one of my latest AI model that is Jarvbita , Unfortunately the AI is in under construction I am developing that write now.
                <br>
                However here I am going to publish the link of the application in order to download and use that application .
                <br>
                Here is the documentation:::---

                        </u>

                <div class="content_s">

                    Here I am going to introduce my AI model which is normally or generally a web browser where the end user can browse google , youtube and also wikipedia at a time.
                    <br>
                    The basic pupose to create this GUI AI model is to make the research more easier.
                    <br>
                    Someone is searching for something that may be for any information or for any other reason he or she have to search at google then again search on youtube for visual representation and if he or she is in search for any information he or she have to go for wikipedia again how ever this type of work makes so much of <u><b>wastage of time</b></u>. However if he or she will get such type of application where he or she can compare google , youtube and wikipedia at a time , then that will be a great power for him or her.
                    <br>
                    So here introducing AIPY my first AI model in GUI form.
                    Here you can perform these tasks::---
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    ==> Click <b>search</b> button for searching the result on <b><i>wikipedia</i></b>.<br>
                    ==> Click <b>Google</b> button for searching the result on <b><i>google</i></b>.<br>
                    ==> Click <b>YT</b> button for searching the result on <b><i>youtube</i></b>.<br>
                    <img src="e.png" height="250px" width="800px"><br>
                    ==> Click this area then start writing the keyword which you want to get informations.
